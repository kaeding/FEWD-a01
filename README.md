## Introduction

Hi, this is Kari! I have spent many years as an engineer in the aerospace industry but am now an aspiring _web developer and designer_. That's why I'm currently spending my days in the Front End Web Development Certification Program thru San Diego Continuing Education. I also have a background in graphic design and multimedia (back in it's glorious youth!).

### Some Favorite Things in Life
I'm a bit of a **_"water-holic"_**. Even the frozen variety! I love to spend time in *Baja*, not just for the water sports but for the camping and comraderie I always find there. The family also spends as much time as possible out on the *Colorado River* where you can just cruise around in the boat or get pulled by the boat. It's all good! I also spend as much time as possible at *Mammoth Mountain* in the winter. It's such an awesome and beautiful place. Maybe we've all met on the water or on the slopes over the years.

So here are just a **few** of my favorites:
* windsurfing
* kiteboarding
* wakeboarding
* wake surfing
* water skiing
* snowboarding
* skiing

Here's a picture during one of my Maui trips:
